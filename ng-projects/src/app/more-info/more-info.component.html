          Born in Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa. I was first introduced to coding
          in 2016 where I learned HTML and CSS and straight after I learned
          Wordpress. My knowledge was further expanded when I join Netwise
          Multi-Media in 2018 and worked solely on CMS sites (mainly Joomla and
          on occasion Wordpress) building custom css design structures with
          bootstrap according to the client's needs. <br/>
          <br/>
          I later worked at Neighbiz as a UI/UX designer and frontend developer.
          My design stack was mainly Flinto (for prototyping) and Sketch (for
          design and wireframing), but later worked with Figma and Adobe XD. I
          was the only designer at the company. On the frontend side I
          collaborated in a team of 5, my role involved building Vue.js
          components where needed.
